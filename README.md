# pwmgr-c - password manager written in C
Started out as a port of pwmgr, written in C instead of python...  
However, that is no longer the case - the code is not a direct port, but instead a complete rewrite and will be FAR better and more secure.  
That being said, it isn't quite ready for use yet.
